yungw9,iwapux4,2022-11-14 05:56:15,">SpaceX shareholders own part of the company but they aren't profit sharing or anything.
Oof buddy. Profits are literally what shareholders are sharing. That and ownership of a corporation's assets, including its cash. If a company A executive props company B up with company A's cash, they diminish both asset value and future profits: They are simply robbing company A's shareholders. I know you want to stan for Musk, but this is pretty basic corporate governance and ethics.
>They aren't entitled to SpaceXs cash any more than one would be to a publicly traded companies cash.
Exactly. Musk is a co-owner of SpaceX and not entitled to their cash. If a SpaceX shareholder wishes to use their investment to support an unrelated business, that is their right. To do so legally, they can sell shares or lobby the board for a dividend. These acts benefit all shareholders equitably.
To support an unrelated business illegally, the SpaceX shareholder can engage in [self-dealing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-dealing.asp) or other forms of misappropriation or theft. An ethical executive would avoid any allegations of self-dealing by recusing themselves from deliberations where they have a conflict of interest (in this case, when SpaceX allocates its advertising budget). A responsible board would insist upon it.",,b82dd6b0349b4e9e4a4150bc8ef64c2ca00313319bcecfc7,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwagl5e,1,1668405375

yt6fxs,iwdj1mp,2022-11-14 21:03:35,"That's not how tax writeoffs work.  
  
First of all, in order to write something off on your taxes, you need to actually be paying those taxes.  Musk doesn't pay taxes on his income (for the most part), because like other ridiculously wealthy people he takes loans against the value of his portfolio so that he never has to realize gains or losses.  
  
As such, all he has to do is pay the interest rate forever (which is less than the rate of growth), and none of his income gets taxed.  It's only when exercising stock options as he did this year that he has to pay any taxes and that's tiny compared to what he spent on Twitter.  
  
To put this into perspective, Musk paid $11 billion in taxes, on about $280 billion in ""income"" over 10 years.  If he could fully realize his loss on Twitter, and his income over the next 10 years is the same, it would mean $236 billion in income, once you subtract the 44 lost, or a reduction of 18%, which against $11 billion in taxes would be worth just under $2 billion written off.  
  
Spending $44 billion to get back $2 billion is not a winning plan.  In fact, assuming he can stem Twitters losses to just $2 billion/year, it would take 22 years for him to break even with selling Twitter off for nothing versus just hanging onto it and trying to lose less.  
  
That is not a winning strategy.",,ed69d1c63921274388351e921d8c47be569e1e1c0d173ad6,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iw65fjy,1,1668459815

He didn’t find Tesla. He bought his way in for line $6.5 million and made himself “founder” By suing people. Then he stared living off the hundreds of billions of dollars in welfare the government gave him. 
Space X was the first real company he actually founded, and it still only succeeded thanks to billions in government welfare prior to even winning any contracts. He can’t count on billions in government welfare propping up Twitter.

If America is serious about winning in near-peer conflicts, we need to begin wrangling in the military industrial complex.
Industrialization and manufacturing still win wars. It’s exactly what we saw with SpaceX and the Boeing/Lockheed partnership. For decades we operated under the assumption that space was fundamentally hard and that we needed these bloated contracts to operate. Then Elon Musk and SpaceX came around and absolutely crushed the old school players in the market. Every other space company is obsolete because of what Falcon 9 can do in terms of cost and reliability. Even the next generation vehicles like SLS are basically dead on arrival due to program costs. It’s absolutely insane the stagnation that industry caused in the space business. 
Our military suffers from the same problem. As we aim to out compete and deter rogue states like Russia, we have to remember the true danger here. The military industrial complex no longer serves the interest of the American public and is not justified by the protection it claims to provide.

I'm sorry but you're completely wrong - it's not even funny how ignorant of an opinion this is - I'm insane for calling him out for openly stating that he thinks it was an intentional act? I don't care if he's Polish or not, Ukraine is in a defensive war against a World Power because the ambitions and ego of Putin and yet we should just let people get away with openly saying without even a trace of evidence that Ukraine did it on purpose./  
That's dumb as fuck, I'd be more polite but your comment is so outrageously stupid that I don't think you deserve it.  
I also doubt he is Polish at this point - his spends most of his time in /r/NYC and says he is from NYC in a post, also spends most of his time discussing US politics such as calling Biden a fascist - he could have moved from Poland but at this point I doubt that as well.
>Ukraine certainly did fire a missile on purpose. What we don't know is whether they intended to hit poland or not.
Right - we DONT KNOW and yet you are calling me insane for calling out someone insinuating we do know and that it was on purpose.

Right - so I'm wrong to call a guy who is spamming quite literal Russian Propaganda taglines a bot, but any defence of Ukraine makes me want to support genocide - hypocrisy if evidently lost on you as a concept isn't it?  
From high horse to idiot in just one post. Well done.

Even 4chan knew within an hour of the news that there's no way it was Russia given an S300 only has a 300km range. How long did it take for you to admit it was Ukraine who killed those Polish citizens?
Seriously - you've gone from calling me insane to quite literally making shit up to justify that original post of yours, fall from grace.  
I haven't commented at all on the missile strike until the facts came out - in fact if you check my profile I have made exactly one comment on this site in 5 days and that was about Elon Musk vs his own Programmers.

Tesla was experiencing significant drops in share price and its future outlook is not amazing as other car manufacturers are bringing electric vehicles to market - Tesla doesn't offer better quality vehicles (they're pretty awful for the price in terms of build quality), their big plus was first mover advantage which is now gone.
Tesla stock was going down, and Musk wanted to offload a ton of it in order to cash out bc it's unlikely to be as high as it was ever again. However, the moment he announces plans to sell stock that affects the price. So in order to try and buoy the stock price he announced he wanted to buy Twitter and that he needed to sell some Tesla stock to finance the purchase, otherwise he'd never do it.
So he sold $7 billion worth of Tesla stock in order to help finance the purchase, but given how he pretty much immediately pulled back it seems his plan was to sell the stock, cancel the purchase of Twitter, and run off with his big bag full of money while Tesla shareholders got boned as it fell. He then announced that he would not be selling any more Tesla stock in order to try and maintain the shareholders' confidence. Then he turned around and sold another $4 billion last week, saying he needs it to fund Twitter's day to day operations, which has led to Tesla stock going down another 10% or so after he sold.
That kind of behavior pisses off investors big time. His purchase of Twitter has also pissed off a lot of the partners who went in on it with him (the guy who runs Binance is apparently on the warpath because he feels Musk used him to enrich himself and now his investment is basically worthless).",,845cc1eb036581806442edf7004a37b6ada9f4ed32ffd4e0,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwlcx5w,1,1668610342

Could it be to  save his life and Starlink or even to prevent nuclear war?   Musk's actions start to make sense if he's terrified of threats by Putin.
Russian officials  publicly complained about Musk helping Ukraine militarily with Starlink satellite communication.

We will not do so unless at gunpoint. Sorry to be such an absolutist."" [SOURCE](https://theconversation.com/why-elon-musks-first-week-as-twitter-owner-has-users-flocking-elsewhere-193857).

On October 3, Musk tweeted a peace plan proposal suggesting Ukraine give up Crimea since it was part of Russia   ""since 1783 (until Krushchev's mistake)"".  That sounds like something Putin told him to say.
 
[Vice news  reported](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ake44z/elon-musk-vladimir-putin-ukraine] in October that Putin talked to Musk about space 18 months earlier (which was well before Russia invaded Ukraine).

Any damage (there's always damage) has to be necessary, has to have a rationale.

ywoieq,iwmpvhv,2022-11-16 19:58:40,"**Short version:** One small shareholder is suing the Tesla Board of Directors and Elon Musk, on behalf of all shareholders, over a $55B pay package. He wants this pay returned to the company. He claims that Musk influenced the board to accept this package and misled shareholders about the deal. Shareholders voted to approve the deal based on information from the Board. 
**Long version:** Because Elon Musk is known for being a serial entrepreneur (in the words of the board), the Tesla board wanted to offer a pay package that ensured his focus remained on Tesla. For this, they set twelve milestones in 2018. For each milestone achieved, Musk would receive 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant. As of now, 11/12 milestones have been achieved and he’s gained about $55B in stock; when he hits the twelfth, he’ll have gone from a 22% to a 28% stake. 
Tornetta, a shareholder with just eight shares, filed a suit against Musk and other Tesla directors, on behalf of the shareholders, to return those shares to Tesla. He isn’t suing for personal damages. 
The lawsuit claims that Musk used his control over the company and board to secure this package, and that his interest in the company could have been secured without giving so much of the company away. It also claims that Musk misled shareholders about the state of the company, leading them to believe it would be harder to achieve those milestones (the shareholders voted to support the board’s proposed compensation plan). It claims his focus hasn’t been entirely on Tesla (SpaceX, The Boring Co, Neuralink, and Twitter). 
Supporting those claims is the fact that the board, at the time, had his own brother and two very close friends on it. Musk described the pay negotiations *in court* as “me negotiating against myself,” and he sent an email to former Chief Legal Officer Todd Maron saying that if a specific large investor voted it down, they “weren’t welcome” at Tesla anymore. The Board did not tell investors that some of the milestones were predicted internally to be met within the first year. Also, this compensation package was supposed to last for at least the next decade, based on information given to shareholders at the voting period. 
The lawsuit has teeth, especially because this is the largest CEO pay package ever by an order of magnitude. It will be hard to justify pay THAT high without admitting to any bias.",,a073053a91f12a230adfc3a1c675d807a4ccd71f39d99e93,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwm0j2n,1,1668628720

Easy, because the past two weeks have been nothing but bad press for Twitter driven by Musk's decisions on how to run the company. This whole ""fiasco"" is barely a blip on a radar littered with actual major blips.
You know what *is* a shitstorm for the company? 
* Rushing out a poorly-thought out paid feature that took an already brand-unsafe medium and made it even more brand-unsafe for advertisers. 
* Blocking marketers who are raising valid points about the brand safety of the platform, hinting that, no, Musk actually *doesn't* welcome criticism and driving away even more advertisers in the process. 
* Laying off 3,700 employees, and doing it in such a rushed fashion that you embarrassingly have to ask some of them back. 
* When that causes several top-end executives such as the Chief Info Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer to all leave on the same day.
* Blanket demanding that whatever employees you haven't fired to work long hours or be laid off (despite the fact that the company employs people in multiple countries, some of which have stricter labor laws than others.)
* Drawing the watchful eye of the FTC because your handling of a company within two weeks has them worried that they'll violate the FTC consent decree.
So yeah, no, one single engineer correcting Musk on Twitter is not causing a shit storm. It's a shit droplet of rain compared to the actual shitstorm that Musk has wrought upon the company since he bought it.

I think it's common knowledge these days that HR and C-Suites tends to cause a great deal of harm to the every issue related to staffing and company culture.  And we've been seeing a lot of that on public display lately.
> Most are just as good as people from other schools/companies
This is somewhat true, but there is also a self-selection bias where over time the quality people tend to gravitate towards the higher quality jobs, and vice versa.  If your company has a terrible reputation, you can expect terrible candidates. 
> They will often work the same or less than others - but always with cynicism.
This happens to anyone who gets burnt out and is coming from a place with a really bad culture.  It has very little to do with how big or famous a company is, even if it tends to affect a lot of the people with the most potential.  Here is where your mentorship and coaching can really come into play.  Help someone fix their career path and give them the tools to succeed and you'll earn their loyalty.

yxfz4p,iwpk2co,2022-11-17 11:49:08,"I find it wrong to point at Musk for buying twitter for several reasons.
First is that it was a shotgun wedding, Musk never intended to buy it and was trolling. Market regulators didn't like him messing about and forced him to go through. Market regulators did this because they were sick of him skirting rules about speculating  buying this or that and his crypto manipulation through tweets.
Two is because he's just setting a policy, he's not really out to control Twitter or what people say. In the case of many massive media owners it's very easy to see them influence the political positions promoted on their newspaper or TV channel. He's not really out to do that and the people who do that with traditional media are not being pointed at for doing worse.
Third is that Elon Musk is just a weirdo asshole with too much reputation, which is why I and many others don't like him. Pointing at him for doing things on twitter mostly causes opinions to fall into the two camps that already exist on him, regardless of twitter itself and what his policy on twitter means for rich people influencing politics. If you hate Elon you're probably of the opinion he's destroying twitter and endangering democracy and if you like him you think he's saving the virtual town square from censorship.",,f9f86c4d0e0f32e8e08da855bf9228303f5b58ba093e9e3a,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,worldnews,t1_iwph2jy,1,1668685748

* Free gyms, all these hilarious blue bicycles you can ride

He offered FAR too much money for an absolutely garbage business at the veey top of the market and signed an ironclad commitment  He couldn't get out of when he realized how badly he fucked up. Then spent the next 6 months making a fucking fool out of himself.
Then he walked through the doors like it was the second coming of Jesus and did literally everything wrong that could be done wrong. His chaos lost all their advertisers and 2023 ad fronts fled and word is that those fronts are down like 75%, a core sector to the business that reflects like 90%+ of its revenue, he started fucking around with the backend processes he knew nothing about and broke the platforms 2FA, he drove employees to quit, laid off a bunch Then asked half of them back because they were essential
What a fucking embarrassment tbh.
He could've made any one of a 100 phonecalls and just got someone else compotent to run things or even help.
He's going to not only lose Twitter to a Consortium of Banks hes also probably going ro lose control of Tesla from this as well.
He saddled this company with an additional Billion dollars of debt on top of all its other obligations....this company has only cleared a B in positive revenue 2x in over 10y.

For example, [if I lay it out working backwards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/yucvbh/smacked_by_his_own_platform/iw98dzw/):
> 1. Why fire and drive people off? It's the simplest way to reduce how much money Twitter is losing--at least in the very short term--because salaries are probably one of Twitter's bigger expenses. 
2. Why worried about profit? Because the company is now suddenly losing *a lot* more money every month, because it has to pay interest on very big loans.
3. Why take out big loans? Because it was part of the deal that allowed Musk to take over the company. (""Leveraged buyout"", [more or less](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/elon-musks-twitter-deal-is-different-than-most-lbos-heres-how/2022/11/12/7c671b64-62b9-11ed-a131-e900e4a6336b_story.html))
4. Why take over the company? Musk found himself in a legal situation where he either *had* to finish buying it, or begin a nasty lawsuit in court.
5. Why avoid the lawsuit? When it goes to court each side gets to demand certain things from the other in ""discovery"" of evidence, such as related emails Musk may have sent to his financial advisors or lawyers or whatever.
6. What could Musk have to hide? Possibly some things that could land him in jail. For example, if his entire offer to buy Twitter was fake from the very beginning.
7. Why would he make a big public fake offer, and why could that mean criminal charges? The offer allowed him to liquidate $8 billion of Tesla stock, in a time/manner that would be very beneficial to his own wealth but would otherwise be prohibited, taxed differently, or have caused a drop in the remaining Tesla share-prices.

According to sources like Zoe Schiffer:
[Thread from nitter so you don't get hit with Twitter's paywall thingie](https://nitter.net/ZoeSchiffer/status/1593391954301054976?cxt=HHwWgMCjgcri7pwsAAAA)
Musk doesn't know who of his 3700 employees quit by defacto at 5pm, just apparently who said ""yes"" to his ""do you like me?"" email he sent out at midnight yesterday saying ""You have to agree to basically destroy your life to make Twitter 2.0 something ""hardcore"" and if you don't agree by 5pm tomorrow that will be your resignation"".
 So they haven't actually turned anyone's accounts off as of like 3 hours later because they don't know whose to turn off. They did however close all twitter offices until Nov 21st (Monday) and turned off everyone's keycards to get into the buildings. 
That might change at any moment. Twitter is under code-lock, so in theory it can't be changed by someone sitting at home remoting in with a bottle of jack daniels and a grudge. According to the scuttlebutt they're terrified of sabotage on site and that's why they turned off \*everyone's\* keycards until Monday.

It just doesn’t make sense for him to risk his name, one of his most valuable assets, on a foreign payout.
My guess is that Musk did legitimately buy into his own hype and think that he’d be able to ‘save Twitter’.

Given US elections in 2024, I wouldn’t put it past some right wing folk to put some money in.
Bottom line, if he can keep the site up & attract staff & advertisers (won’t be easy), Twitter could make a comeback. But at this point he’s got a reputation problem.

yy8juc,iwti2bn,2022-11-18 05:47:07,">it’s one thing to force this “extreme culture” at a company like SpaceX, where there’s VERY few other opportunities for similar work
There's another important differentiator between SpaceX and Twitter, beyond competition for employees: the meaningfulness of the work.
SpaceX *could* literally elevate mankind.  I'm talking its ceiling.  A few years ago, SpaceX live-streamed the automated landing of their booster rockets.  It's a critical step in enabling cheaper flights and quicker turnaround time, and they validated it.  Musk did a press conference afterward, and he commented that he imagined a long row of launchpads, with rockets constantly going off, and boosters constantly returning to land and be reused.  Human transport would be one use case, but even potentially for shipping.
It's not a question of 'if' this will happen, it's 'when'.  Something like that could normalize basic space travel (or near-space travel), and who knows what could come next.  The potential ceiling for something like SpaceX is to be written into the history of mankind, following the chapter on the moon landing.
Twitter has memes.  It certainly has value, but it simply doesn't compare to the engineering feat and impact of space travel.  Tesla is similar.  Though ironically, you could reasonably argue that Twitter has more impact on our day to day lives than SpaceX.  
Most engineers are well aware that SpaceX and Tesla practically try to burn you out.  But people still go there, and a non-negligible aspect of that motivation is the desire to help mankind, and the motivation to conquer challenging problems.  Heck, I'd have gone there myself if I wasn't already burned out from grad school.
Twitter certainly has its own portfolio of legit engineering challenges, and I'm sure there are talented engineers who get off on solving them.  But I have to imagine that few people are willing to overwork themselves for whatever fruit Twitter bears.",,921a059f43511d665fef1c04b456d8bd429fab295f7dfec7,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,worldnews,t1_iwt0x64,1,1668750427

yy7y2a,iwtpvjq,2022-11-18 07:24:05,"Unprofitable and losing money?  Yes.  
  
At the time of purchase, Twitter had $5 billion in revenue, $5.2 billion in expenses, $2 billion in cash reserves (this is 10-20 years of operating expenses).  
  
As soon as they were purchased those expenses jumped to 6.7 billion, reducing them to about a year of operating expenses.  This is due to interest to finance the debt they took on in the purchase agreement.  
  
After this, Musk blew a once a year convention where companies lock in ad buys for a year.  Normally this is $1 billion or so of Twitters revenue.  Thanks to how Musk handled it, they got $0.  This dropped their revenue the following year to $4 billion against 6.7 in expenses.  So 8 months of runway.  
  
Then, Musk tried the blue checkmark, which apparently made them $200 million or so.  Except it cost them 2 if the 4 big advertising firms recommending clients not buy on twitter.  This is another 40% of revenue, dropping the company to $2 billion against 6.7 in expenses.  
  
So, while they had a very slow bleed before, that was more or less sustainable, Musk in the last 2.5 weeks has made several poor decisions which have caused the companies finances to spiral out of control.  And this happened at a time where their main source of revenue locks in most of their spending a year in advance.  Meaning advertiser revenue cannot improve for the next year so any additional monetization would take a dev team that he fired, to add paid features to Twitter, and this also has a long time to market (though not a year long).",,ed69d1c63921274388351e921d8c47be569e1e1c0d173ad6,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwthjoc,1,1668756245

X.com with *three* other people. How much of any success they achieved was actually him? We don't know.
X.com merged to become PayPal. Musk was yet again removed as CEO. Only after his company merged and then he was removed from CEO, did it become a success.
SpaceX. Is it even successful? Or yet another inflated thing he's involved with without a chance of the 'promises' ever happening?
Tesla. Not founded by Musk. Also not successful in terms of profit, just an artificially inflated stock price.
SolarCity. Founded by other people. He was just the financial backer.
Neuralink. Too early to say.
The Boring Company. Only created to stop a railway being built. And his idea instead, a worse railway. Not successful.
Twitter. Well, we can see how that's going. You don't fire important coders, etc. as part of a master plan.
So that's none of those where you can legitimately use your argument in favour of him. 
He also fired employees from SpaceX who criticised him. Not intelligent.
He thought he could save kids trapped in a cave with a submarine. When told by someone smarter than him that it wouldn't work, he called him a pedo. Not intelligent.

Yeah, braindead take.

No. This industry takes months for entry and midlevel people to pass 5-9 stage interviews, and nobody wants to work for TWTR as mungbrained Musk cuts pay and the stock drops.

Musk overpaid and was forced to follow-through with his weaponized boast. Once on board, he faced resistance to his expectations to be adored as a god-king, so he went on  job killing spree.
He has a massive dead weight site that was barely revenue positive when he threatened a takeover. Now that users are leaving, trolls are flooding in, and ad revenue has all but halted, Twitter is the digital version of a last-place local mall whose Prime renters and anchors either went out of business or moved to the new open-air concept district in ShiPaTa. 
His takeover tantrum designed to force a popular platform to permit his public comments unfettered succeeded. Only problem is that he got what he wanted at the expense of the platform itself. 
Staff is leaving; none should have much trouble landing on their feet (aside from recession forces) as a result of their credentials.

His naysayers will say his track record isn’t that great, that he’s got by thanks to rich parents + financial ‘engineering’ at Tesla.
His track record at x.com is pretty poor and he was fired from PayPal post-acquisition.
He’s definitely done well at SpaceX but his track record at Tesla is … erratic (complete with getting sued for lying about taking Tesla private).
A lot of investors don’t believe Tesla’s current market cap is sustainable and as TSLA has tanked he’s facing lawsuits (again). Including the allegation that he’s lied about his educational qualifications.
I don’t have a horse in this battle, but his track record definitely doesn’t read as well as his fans make it out to be. 
The most insightful thing I read suggested that he massively misread the problem — SpaceX and even Tesla solve lots of engineering challenges, so being “hardcore” might work. (Others will say Tesla’s design predated Musk, and his promises around “full self driving” have basically come up empty, so how well hardcore is working for Tesla is debatable.)
Twitter has to battle human nature (trolls, etc). Being hardcore isn’t going to cut it because you can’t engineer for human nature.  You need moderation, anti-abuse etc.His bull-in-a-China-shop approach shows he doesn’t understand that. Even now, his bro-tweeting hasn’t stopped.

ywl6g3,iwucvl3,2022-11-18 12:34:28,"Are you always this hostile when someone is genuinely interested in the information that you share and wants to know more? And yes, normally if you make a claim like “the US bans peace talks because it would use the deaths of Ukrainian civilians to weaken the Russian military”, you provide a source. That’s not spoon-feeding, that’s called the burden of proof. And i didn’t ask maliciously, i asked because i would like to know more about it and can’t directly find something backing up that claim.
There have been negotiations and peace talks, 5 direct UKR-RUS ones to be precise. All of them leading to nothing. There have been more attempts to negotiate cease-fires and peace, also from the West.
Russia has previously been deceitful when it comes to both their historic treaties and their [disinformation warfare doctrine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_deception), a very active doctrine stemming from the early 20th and put to use during many the [2016 US presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections), the [annexing of Crimea in 2014](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_information_war_against_Ukraine) and [the invasion of Ukraine in general](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/china/disinformation-about-russias-invasion-ukraine-debunking-seven-myths-spread-russia_en?s=166) the Cuban missile crisis and the Prague spring, just to name a couple of examples. Up to this day they claim to have not invaded Ukraine, they claim missile strikes are false flag operations by Ukraine, they lied about the mobilization prior to the invasion claiming it to be merely an exercise, they invaded Georgie in 2008, they annexed Crimea in 2014, they [violated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html?_r=0) the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty by testing the SSC-8 cruise missile and SS-25 and RS-26 ICBMs, they [violated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-moves-closer-to-ending-another-post-cold-war-treaty-11572177600?mod=article_inline) the open skies treaty by disallowing flights over certain key areas such as Russian-controlled Georgie and central Russia, where a military exercise was being conducted in may and september of 2020 respectively, where the intelligence community believes it stores nuclear weaponry capable of striking the entirety of Europe, they sought to [infiltrate](https://www.politico.eu/article/netherlands-intelligence-prevented-russia-spy-from-targeting-international-criminal-court-the-hague/amp/) the international criminal court in the Hague in the Netherlands, they sought to [spy in the Dutch high-tech sector and to recruit informants and in total 20 spies got deported](https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2448337-here-is-what-we-know-about-the-russian-spies-in-the-netherlands). they mask their intentions in a torrent of lies for the purpose of sowing discord and bolstering support, both internally and internationally. These are just a drop in the bucket of examples of Russian disinformation campaigns but it shows that Russia is not a trustworthy party when it comes to diplomacy and their word is not valuable and can change at a whin. I am not even talking about the information warfare happening in cyberspace, state-controlled media, censorship and fake referendums. Truth does not matter anymore in Russian doctrine.
So how exactly do you negotiate peace with a party that can’t be trusted? And don’t give me the whataboutism of the US being untrustworthy, that’s neither here nor there as they are not the ones invading Ukraine at the moment, i will be the first to call out BS from them too. [87% of the Ukrainians will not give an inch to Russia in exchange for peace](https://www.euronews.com/2022/09/16/ukraine-crisis-concessions-poll), even if that means prolonging the war. Meanwhile, US officials noted that Ukraine and Russia appeared to have reached an agreement on the outline of a settlement in which Russia would retreat back to pre-invasion lines in exchange for Ukraine not seeking NATO membership. This however was shot down by Russia, with Lavrov stating that this was no longer an option as the [“geography had changed” and the Donbas was no longer enough](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/world-putin-wants-fiona-hill-angela-stent). The [chancellor of Austria](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/11/europe/austria-nehammer-putin-meeting-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html) and the [Secretary General of the United Nations](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-united-nations-putin-moscow-meeting/) talked with Putin about potential peace negotiations but both came out verg skeptic of a possibility of peace citing the very different perspectives on the circumstances of the invasion adopted by both countries. Secretary of [Defense Austin spoke with his Russian counterpart](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3487612-austin-speaks-with-russian-counterpart-for-first-time-since-start-of-war-in-ukraine/) and urged for an immediate cease-fire and to continue to maintain the lines of communication in May. Suggestions to concede the Donbas region to Russia (by former diplomat Henry Kissinger and public figures such as Elon Musk) have been denounced by both Zelensky and the Ukrainian people. Russian Chief of Staff Kozak had reportedly reached an agreement early in the war in which Ukraine would not join NATO, Russia’s main concern, but this was [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-war-began-putin-rejected-ukraine-peace-deal-recommended-by-his-aide-2022-09-14/) by Putin who now expanded the objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian land. Zelensky stated that peace talks could be initiated if Russia retreated all troops out of Ukraine, to which Putin responded that Russia annexed four parts of Ukraine originally seized in the early invasion. As a response, Zelensky stated that peace talks would not happen as long as Putin remains President.
Boris Johnson had indeed told Zelensky that Putin is a war criminal that shouldn’t be negotiated with during a surprise visit, but if that example is to be made as an argument for the refusal of the West to help negotiate peace than it’s seriously doing an injustice to all the earnest attempts to broker peace.
Now that Kherson has been liberated and winter is approaching, [US officials are nudging Ukrainian government towards peace negotiations again](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-ukraine-retakes-kherson-u-s-looks-to-diplomacy-before-winter-slows-momentum-11668345883?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1), citing the winter would slow down progress and extend the war and doubts over the ability of both sides to take land.
So peace negotiations were attempted by all sides, but both parties couldn’t come to an agreement, Russia keeps changing the narrative and the objective, which in combination with their propensity to lie for strategic advantages has caused severe skepticism on the veracity of purported peace talks. Ukrainian people do not support giving up territory in exchange for peace, and neither does Zelensky. And now that winter is coming and the war might grind down to a halt, the US is trying to nudge Ukraine to attempt peace once more. So let me ask you, you said the war would have been long over if the US and the West would allow peace talks. If it’s so easy, what terms would you propose to satisfy both countries and end the war?

How they keep the software running, keeping systems up, distributing info, etc. So he laid off half his intellectual property, then got rid of some via consultant firings, and probably will lose another half today.

This whole thing started with Musk being unhappy with Twitter, ridiculously accusing it of being a threat to free speech and democracy. (I think this rhetoric started around the time Trump got banned, but I'm not real sure.) He then starts to buy up stock in the company and eventually becomes the largest shareholder. His goal is to literally buy his way into becoming a board member and attempt to convince the company go private. His goal was very close to becoming realized, but he managed to fuck that up after pissing off Twitter's CEO by posting some inflammatory anti-Twitter shit online.
This must have, in turn, pissed off Musk. So then, with the full force of his Fuck-You Money, Musk reveals his securities filing to buy the company. Twitter board members negotiate and agree to sell the company for $44 billion.
Then, all of a sudden, Musk starts to change his mind. He says Twitter has a bot problem, and puts the deal on hold. Eventually, citing the bot problem, he tries to cancel the deal outright. Meanwhile, Twitter's stock drops. 
Twitter sues, and I think Musk counter sues. Eventually, and I'm not clear on the details here, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal forces Musk to buy the company for $44 billion. It is my contention this must have infuriated Musk. So now he has a company he does seem to really want anymore. Later, Musk is on record stating he intends to reduce Twitter's 7500+ employee staff by 75%. His first act upon ownership was to spitefully fire Parag Agrawal.
I really don't think Musk gives any fucks about what he's doing, and certainly cares little about those he's affecting.

I am a neutral person who is about as “center” as you can be today, but I have seen Twitter go from mostly news (think Arab Spring, major weather events, etc) to just yelling back and forth. No matter what “side” you’re on, look at any Tweet by a major political figure or celebrity and read the replies. They’re the exact opposite of the tweet. Just yelling and insulting. UGH. IDK if Twitter goes away, honestly. I use it for sports mostly, to keep up on the NFL or NBA. Otherwise I could not care less. If Musk wants to dump everyone and hire who he wants, by all means go ahead. I don’t think he’s stupid. Nor do I put him on some pedestal like his fanboys. I think he has a method to all this, and wants to reshape the platform as he sees fit. The narratives coming out need to be taken with a grain of salt, just like any “news” these days. Consider the sources….angry Twitter fans and employees/ex employees who have an axe to grind. But they probably did have some bloat that needed to be dealt with. I’ve seen the ones who posted, bragging about how they only worked like 8 days a month. If they got the job done in that short time, then either the job isn’t needed or they aren’t working hard enough….but the hand-wringing over Twitter?? I don’t see the same outcry about Meta who just laid off a ton of people. It’s only bc Elon bought it.

yyghiy,iwuvss6,2022-11-18 15:11:10,"Ok, I will explain. I actually am married to a historian and have an MA in history myself, so....
You are conflating a momentary (and I would argue inevitable) rise in global health standards and consumer power with sustainable government and industry. Yes, it seemed (to some people) that capitalism ""worked"" (that is, if you ignore all the little people who were squashed during the long  20th century so we could have things like lawns and three cars per family). So in the short term, you are very right. China has a rising middle class. Diseases are more curable than ever. Africa has more money. Yes, YES! 
BUT.
You are underestimating the unseen cost, as you have likely been taught to. I am not saying we are headed for a dystopian hells cape tomorrow because of Elon Musk and Bezos. I AM saying that you and others like you (and I actually have a soft spot for libertarians because reasons) are simply unwilling to look at the big picture. Information will rule the new century, and at this moment it is actually already impossible to know what is true and what isn't, and that will only get worse. Think this doesn't matter? It's likely the only thing that matters. All one has to do is look at the house of mirrors that is the Russian state to see where this is all headed. Honestly the socialism vs. democracy debate is so 20th century. That is not the battle we need to be fighting! No one thinks real democracy is bad, it's just that it doesn't (and likely cannot) exist. I would argue its libertarians who are living in a utopia, thinking the free market can correct for all eventualities. The way the system exists today makes it impossible. What happens when Elon fires all his workers and hires new ones at lower salary? How many times can the oligarchs do this? I will argue they can and will do until the workers are like serfs. At some point there becomes no choice, when people are functionally locked out of schooling, when people cannot afford rent or even heat (Europe), etc. Are you going to argue they should just work harder or be born richer? I honestly can't believe I'm even having this discussion? 
Can I ask you a question? Have you watched anything by Adam Curtis? If not I would recommend. I would recommend his new documentary about the fall of the soviet union and the fall of democracy in Russia, he makes it very easy to see how it will go for the west if things don't change.",,0849d073da2566a804fb16e09292c37dba6f43346d7dfd39,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,worldnews,t1_iwutt28,1,1668784270

 Musk on Monday got into a dispute with software engineer Eric Frohnhoefer on Twitter that ended with the billionaire tweeting “he’s fired,” and Frohnhoefer confirming he’d lost access to Twitter’s internal systems.

Frohnhoefer told CNN Monday night that he found out about the firing when a friend sent him Musk’s tweet and said that “no one even reached out to me from Twitter.” Frohnhoefer added that he had been “willing to give it a try” under Musk and described himself as “in the wait-and-see camp,” but that “everything that has been reported is true.” He described working for Musk as a “total sh*t show” and the current state of affairs as pure “chaos.”

Musk is a great entrepreneur but he randomly spent $44B to buy someone else's company just because it's his favorite place to troll the internet.

I don't think anyone could have predicted he'd F things up this badly and this quickly.
The only people who were ever excited about Musk buying Twitter are those who hoped he would open up the flood gates to unmitigated hate speech, political misinformation, etc on Twitter (as I said, turning it into a cesspool). All his silly free speech claims lol.
He fired half the staff, then said everyone who is still there should quit unless they aren't prepared to devote their entire lives to the company (or more accurately, to him). Sounds like Twitter could suddenly be down to 25% or less of their workforce. He also implemented the stupid pay for verification thing which was an immediate fail and made a mess of Twitter. They also managed to lose a lot of their ad income because advertisers started jumping ship as soon as Musk took over because everyone knew this was going to be a sh\*tshow.
Night and day difference between Musk building a company to change things and Musk buying a company as a pure ego trip.

Not at all. Why do you think that?
>This explains what I'm meaning more eloquently.
It does, but there's still parts that don't make sense. And even if every single thing there is true, there's still bad decisions.
It assumes he'll pop up and say it's wrong if it is... But why would he. More than likely he's just being an absolute moron, so if someone comes out backing him up and providing reasoning he can use, that's better than what his actual reasoning was, then why would he pop up and say it's wrong? This is a bad start for the tweets.
10% of people don't do 90% of the work. That just isn't true, regardless of whether it's a common saying. 
Testing people by setting a bullshit task that would ruin the company, and then getting rid of people not happy with that, is not a good way to run a company. I highly doubt he would listen to any queries of it, because he fires people who criticise him. So if that was his reasoning that isn't backing up the point that he is good. If that really was his reasoning, it's still showing he's bad because he chose a task that once implemented, caused many big advertisers to leave the platform. All to test employees, and remove the ones who didn't suck up to him.
Someone can't work like 10 people unless they are overworked, and even then, very unlikely. Removing 90% of people doesn't mean those left do the work of 10 people. That's utterly insane to suggest. It just doesn't work. More crap 'logic'.
That paraphrasing is wrong, it should be 'anyone who doesn't kiss my ass and agree with every single thing I say is fired'.
It doesn't reveal who is there to make Twitter a better product, it revealed who was there to do what he asks without question. Again, not a good thing in the long run.
It also doesn't explain why many of the people he fired had other huge companies lining up for them... Why would they do that if they were lazy, unproductive, and brought others down?
If he did it purposely to get rid of the people who were an issue, why did he shut the offices after he already did that? Why would he still be worried about the employees he put through all of these tests and then decided to keep?
Keeping yes people and ignoring anyone criticising, etc. is not the way to run a successful business. Eventually it will catch up to you.
So even if that is 100% true, which I highly doubt, as there's no evidence of it, or even than Musk is a good businessman, that still shows he is bad anyway, so I'm not really sure what the goal of that is.

As for not being able to get back in, maybe. More importantly they don't know who they fired.
Musk was bluffing. He said ""click yes or leave with 3 months severance"" but there were no specifics on that severance. Was it severance or garden leave? Revokable if you took another job or yours to keep? Any conditions on the severance? How would accepted but unvested benefits be treated? Etc...
Normally this stuff would be covered in a formal severance offer letter which would be accepted or refused by the employees. Without it you would be crazy as an employee to walk out.
But the employees looked around and said: better to get the WARN act minimum then go down with the ship, and just walked out. They couldn't even formally accept the offer as there was no mechanism to do so. The poll didn't allow you to click ""no"".
So now HR has to figure out what the duck just happened. Who still works at the firm? Perhaps starting with HR. Who works in HR?

Furthermore a CEO is so far removed from what the engineers are doing he probably doesn’t even see any engineers outside of team leads reporting back to him. Yeah he might claim he’s not a true CEO, but as CEO he still has actual duties he fulfills to appease shareholders, and if he didn’t they would replace him. Yes, “make us more money” is obviously the most important one, but he still needs to attend meetings among the higher ups, and make decisions of where the company is going and what it’s going to invest it’s time and resources into. And when I say “make decisions”, I don’t mean an on the whim decision, choosing one thing over the other, it’s normally after countless analytics and data are collected and given to him. all of that takes time and can’t be done simultaneously while trying to “be an engineer”.

Here's why the deal was good for shareholders. Their stock was worth $21 a share at the time of this deal. The company wanted to increase that, so it incentivized him to do it, and it guarantees he stays on as CEO, actively managing the company if he wants any rewards. And these aren't peaks, the value must be sustained above the target for six months. And so he doesn't just play with stock values using the usual tricks (Carly Fiorina anyone?), they also include hard performance targets for revenue and profitability to ensure the stock value is based on a healthy company. 
These were not easy targets. The financial industry described him hitting even the first milestone as remarkable. Before the agreement, Tesla had $950 million in earnings. The first milestone required $1.5 billion, a 60% increase, and the last milestone required $14 billion, a 1,370% increase. Before the agreement, Tesla had a $50 billion market cap (value of all stock). The first milestone required holding a $100 billion market cap, twice the value, and the last required $650 billion, 13 times the value. 
In short, the agreement required that Musk grow the company at an absolutely insane rate if he wanted to get any compensation since he receives none otherwise -- no salary, no bonuses, no other equity. He risked working for nothing on the bet that he could grow the company that fast. 
Now the shareholder stock is worth $178. That's why the deal is good for shareholders, an 850% return on investment in five years. Their bet in Musk paid off in far higher shareholder value than they're paying him.

I didn't say that. I did mention the startup investment of his parents. 
>A sibling with startup money who you're working with is still startup money.
$20K. We're not talking big investment money here, not daddy gave me a free ride. He also didn't have a free work space, having to rent office space on that tiny budget. It really was a shoestring budget company until a later round of investment (when his dad invested a small percentage of the round). 
And then with $22 million from its sale he founded another company and sold that for $176 million. And with that he founded SpaceX and was the majority of Tesla's initial fundraising, plus more in a later round. Growing those companies to insane heights is how he really got rich. 
>He had an entire childhood of prep school and the connections that makes. 
In South Africa. Just another fairly well-off kid. Then he got a Canadian passport through his mom, moved to Canada, and worked odd jobs for a living. Where were all those connections then so he didn't have to do menial labor to live? This is not the ""Daddy got me rich"" story you're looking for.
At best you might be able to say he's slightly less self-made than Mark Cuban. There's actually a list of degrees of self-made billionaires out there ranked from 1 (didn't do anything, not doing anything) to 10 (had to overcome serious obstacles to make it). 
At one end is people like Dagmar Dolby, who inherited Dolby Laboratories when her husband died and is not doing a damn thing, just riding on the money. A few down is Trump, inherited large amounts of money, but worked to grow it a lot (despite his failures, he did expand from his dad's holdings considerably). Down at #8 is coming from middle or upper middle class and making it, and that's where Musk and Bezos are. Cuban would be at #9, working class who made it. #10 is reserved for people like Oprah, rare territory.

yyghiy,iww6yjc,2022-11-18 20:32:00,"You've gotten plenty of reality about why Elon is a dipshit who buys into companies instead of being some wunderkind. You muskrats didn't reason yourself into believing he's some tech genius, so I'm not interested in a religious debate with a whackjob. We've moved past that to public mockery. 
For the passer-by who wants brief summary of why you're stupid (please don't get flattered that I spent time on this for you, I just need a post so I can copy-paste from it later):
Facebook, who owns many of the other social media sites you're probably referencing, did layoff about 13% of their workforce. However, that's largely because they've sank an ass-load of money into the Metaverse shit, which was a terrible product that people don't want. I think ad revenue might also be down on Facebook, but the primary driver of their cashflow issues is the insane amount of throwing good money after bad they've done with a dystopian, Facebook-owned VR Chat. They didn't go out and randomly hack off 50% of the workforce, try to get the rest to work 80 hour weeks and have to move to work in the office when they were doing what any sane tech company allows now and doing remote work from home, then go all surprised_pikachu.jpg on us when the workers (who can get jobs just about anywhere else but liked pre-Musk Twitter) took 3 months of severance instead. They had to close their office. Engineers/other staff from within the building were telling reporters that entire teams of critical infrastructure engineers quit all together and ""you can't run Twitter without these teams"". Normies would think that computers just keep running whatever you code on them with no faults or issues in perpetuity without any human interaction. Tell me you've never worked in tech without telling me you've never worked in tech... Even with self-healing hosting like kubernetes with all the monitoring you can imagine, shit does go sideways on occasion, and the first time there's not someone available on call when that happens, expect a lengthy outage. Probably not today nor tomorrow, but these engineers aren't thinking on an hourly timescale like terminally online twitter *users* do.      
By contrast, TikTok is looking to double their staff. It's not endemic to all social media sites right now, just poorly run ones. Various other tech layoffs are broadly due to slumping sales due to the economy slowing (because other corps used the lie of inflation to price-gouge), and most aren't enormous. Microsoft made news for a layoff of... less than 1000 people. In a giant company like MSFT, that's pretty miniscule. 10k from Amazon might be their largest layoff yet, but they employ like 1.5million workers. Nothing remotely like the drunken flailing over at Twitter is happening across the board. The dumbass has made a fool of himself on his own platform multiple times already, too. *As a software engineer myself*, the guy's a poser. He's that guy that regurgitates shit he read on Hacker News or some other site combined with a meager-but-self-inflated tech knowledge and just barfs bullshit that sounds reasonable to ignorant sycophants.

yy7y2a,iwwdg91,2022-11-18 21:16:49,"That's just not reality though regarding their finances.  
  
Before Musks buyout, the company had a market cap of $30 billion with assets valued at $10 billion, including $2 billion in cash as operating capital.  Their annual revenue was $5 billion with annual expenses of $5.2 billion.  Against that operating capital that means they could keep going for 10 years.  Not a great situation to be in since there was no profit, but they were treading water and stable.   
  
The thing is though, the very act of buying the company for $44 billion altered the companies finances.  As part of that buyout, they had to take on $13 billion in debt, so 30% more than their actual physical collateral is worth, at a fairly high interest rate, such that they gained annual interest payments of $1.5 billion to finance it.  
  
This means that without any other changes, the company now has annual expenses of $6.7 billion against revenues of $5 billion.  Notice that this now uses up all their operating capital in just one year.  
  
Just to break even from this point, the company would have to come up with a 30% increase in revenues to get back to the state it was in prior to being acquired.  
  
But, that's not all that happened.  After this, Musk was giving a presentation on ad buys to a group at a convention.  This convention normally is responsible for 20% of Twitters ad buys during the year.  Instead of the expected $1 billion in sales, they got $0, so a loss of 20% revenue.  
  
Following this, major ad networks began pulling out of Twitter due to brand damage related to the blue checkmark changes.  That was another 40% of ad's, or 60% in total lost.  
  
Following all of this, that puts them at an expected revenue for the following year of $2 billion against now $6.7 billion in expenses, and that same $2 billion in operating revenue.  
  
This is why it's crashing and burning.  They went from having a decade of continued operations to 3 months worth.  And while doing this, they fired everyone who knew how anything ran at the company, adding chaos into the mix, making it even harder to keep things running.",,ed69d1c63921274388351e921d8c47be569e1e1c0d173ad6,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwtnzy6,1,1668806209

It's been a big cost for SpaceX, which is not an old company with loads of cash, and is in fact burning through cash very quickly building Starship and deploying Starlink (those 65 launches of thousands of satellites). 
One could say the free offer was one of Musk's famous stupid spur of the moment things because his company really can't afford to keep sending free terminals and providing free service. I guess the bean counters talked to him, so now he's asking that the government pay SpaceX for service as they are paying other companies, and people complain. He never threatened to lock Ukraine out of service entirely, only asked that they start getting paid. 
They are free to use traditional satellite services instead, but they'll be paying a lot more money for less service.

Looking at screenshots of code is a *terrible* way to do that.

And I really like it, as long as you make it obvious that the purpose isn't to just judge a person's work based on the screenshots alone.
If you're going to talk about code with someone, it really helps to have some example code to talk about. And in my experience, of all the possible ways to get good example code, asking someone to bring a few snippets of their own was always the best way.
Again, I have no idea what Musk's going to be doing with it, or why he asked.

yys46e,iwxmkju,2022-11-19 03:11:33,"It's even stupider than you think. Like, by mocking it, u/zxcvb94105 actually made Musk sound *smarter.*
Here's what actually happened: On day one, he demanded that everyone **print out** 50 pages of code they've written in the past 30 days. If you haven't written 50 pages, you could go back to 60 days. They were told to prepare to have this code reviewed by Elon himself.
Then they were told, ""Actually, never mind, you need to immediately shred all the highly confidential code you just printed.""
And this is just... [fractally stupid](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fractal_wrongness)...
---
First: What, exactly, did he want people to print out? We're very rarely writing code from scratch. Think about it -- it's not like they *rewrite Twitter* every time they release a new version of the app. They *change* code.
Here's [a random example](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/commit/c3b2c6396c30159b1cd980262d3d5b51ec6836de). The green parts are line added, and the red parts are lines removed. Notice that this change removes more than it adds. Sometimes it actually takes real engineering work to remove thousands of lines of code.
So when he says ""print out all the pages of code you wrote in the past couple months,"" does he mean to print the entire file you wrote? But files are *very very often* modified by multiple people.
And what if you *deleted* a bunch of code? This is such a well-known blunder that [there's a story from 1982 about that time they tried to measure ""productivity"" by ""lines of code written""](https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt), only to find some people contributed legitimate value by ""writing negative lines of code.""
So... did he mean to print out all of the *changes* you made, like the above? Those might be hard to understand without the rest of the file... Speaking of ""hard to understand"":
---
Second: If you want to review someone's code, you probably want to do that in a system that makes it easy to navigate. For example, say you're looking at [this random line of Chrome (well, Chromium) source code](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:extensions/common/manifest_handlers/background_info.cc;l=54;drc=60039d4d4bd70512e21a2dfe586602aca1d9d35e), and you want to know: It's checking `if (extension->manifest_version() < 3)` ...where is `manifest_version()` coming from? Where's that defined, what does it mean? Well, in that app, *you can literally click on it* and it'll take you [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:extensions/common/extension.h;l=291;drc=bfb8c49dbe07823ef4ebf1a857be9a4d288d1120)... so, it just returns `manifest_version_`, which is... not all that useful, but click on that and you go [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:extensions/common/extension.h;l=420;drc=bfb8c49dbe07823ef4ebf1a857be9a4d288d1120), where there's a helpful comment that explains it in detail.
Not all code is as convoluted as what you'd find in something like Chrome, but it's *always* much easier to navigate on an actual computer. If you use color ink (just to maximize how much you cost Elon when he asks for *fifty pages*) you can at least still get syntax highlighting (everything all neatly color-coded), but if you read something on page 47 that got defined back on page 3, you're going to wish you were dealing with this with anything but a printout.
Well, almost anything. Screenshots have the same problem.
---
So okay, let's assume that after everyone shreds all that code because you're going to show it off in a tool like what I linked above, and you'll be showing the change you made *and* its original context to someone smart enough to appreciate how hard it can be to delete a bunch of code (so, probably not Elon)...
Third: Even very small changes can represent an *enormous* amount of work, not to mention [talent and expertise](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/know-where-man/). The obvious example is tracking down a bug. Very often, these bugs end up being extremely simple to fix once you really understand them -- it can be as simple as [one line](https://github.com/strophe/strophejs/issues/259). And I don't know if that particular issue was hard, but there are plenty that are. Here's what debugging can look like:
* Go back and forth with the user (or whoever reported the bug) to understand what they actually saw.
* Figure out how to *reproduce* the bug -- make the same thing happen to you, reliably and repeatedly.
* Fire up a debugger, or add some logging, or both, to try to get more information about what's actually going on in the program to make that bug happen.
* See something that *looks* like the bug. Make a change and test it... only to discover that the bug is still there, and you've introduced some new ones, too.
* Finally find the one line that's definitely wrong, and fix it. **This is the only part that shows up in your code change.**
* Try to reproduce this bug again. Seems like it's fixed!
* Run the rest of the automated test suite to make sure you didn't break anything else while fixing this bug.
* Send your change to someone else for review, to make sure it looks good.
* Actually push your change into the main repository.
* Write all of that down in the issue tracker (actually this is usually working as you go), and mark the bug as fixed.
And at least in this case, you get credit for writing one line! Sometimes, you get a couple people trying to fix a bug together, and the one who actually wrote the fix might not be the person who did the most work trying to figure it out.
It's not always this bad, but there are definitely days when the *majority* of your day is not spent just typing new lines of code as fast as you possibly can, and it's not just debugging, either.
---
Finally, thinking about the implications of literally printing out all that code should give you a hint at one of the other reasons this is stupid: Twitter had about 5k people. Even if only 20% of them (1k) were engineers when Elon made this stupid decision, he's basically asking for fifty *thousand* pages. Ignoring the environmental impact of all that paper, Elon isn't going to sit down and read the equivalent of a few dozen copies of Ulysses.
Of course, he was reportedly bringing over some Tesla engineers to help, but people were told to prepare for Elon to *personally* review their code.
---
And I'm stopping here not because that's the end of the stupid, but because there's only so much stupid that can fit in a single Reddit post.
It's not unreasonable to ask to see what people have been working on. There will often be *some* sort of evidence (I mentioned that issue tracker). But even if this is what Elon meant, how the hell did it turn into ""pages of code"" by the time it got to employees? Because... at least some of them actually did it, and took selfies with their giant stacks of paper that they had to print and then shred.",,8b357a5c00462cec0ff76dd105ee5727fd53fa0e4ce3824a,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iww1m92,1,1668827493

Additionally, 20% of their ad's for the following year are sold at a big event that happens in early November.  Twitter normally gets $1 billion out of this or so, but this year they got $0.  
  
Their revenue is quickly disintegrating and just cutting headcount isn't going to stop that.  
  
At this point, it's basically impossible for Twitter to generate sufficient revenue to stay operational without taking on even more loans, which means even more revenue will be necessary.  I did the math the other day, and came up roughly with, if they could get half their lost ad revenue back right now, and get a premium service up and running 6 months from now that provides revenue equal to ad revenue (to go along with Musks desire of 50% of revenue coming from ad's), they would just about break even to where they were before.  And this would be to the tune of about $8 billion/year in total revenue (3 billion of that being debt financing at that point).  
  
It was an awful company to purchase, especially at such a markup.  But everyone has been saying that from the start, because a company that just about breaks even is never going to provide a huge ROI unless there was some revolutionary monetization idea involved.",,ed69d1c63921274388351e921d8c47be569e1e1c0d173ad6,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwy4hud,1,1668840028

yys46e,iwzrbbn,2022-11-19 17:02:46,"He has to cut expenses.  I'm not arguing there's not a financial reason to make these cuts.  Instead I'm arguing that I don't think they're going to fix the problems the company has.  
  
Cutting a bunch of staff implies the company was overstaffed, and Musk seems to think that all he needs for Twitter is a few programmers and other tech workers to keep the thing running.  Most of Twitters staff was not CS people, it was other fields involving things like regulatory compliance, PR, managing ad accounts, payroll, content moderation, and so on.  To maintain what they currently had, devs were the least important part of the company, and that's what he kept on.  
  
Also, by eliminating most of his workers, he no longer has the ability to build revenue generating features for the company.  
  
This is the issue, there's no substantial cost cutting through headcount available to get him out of this.  He needs more revenue.  If he fired 90% of employees, hired back no one, and they had an average annual cost of $200k each, that only saves 1.35 billion per year.  Assuming revenue doesn't go down, and that we could wind the clock back to 1 second after he purchased the company so that reputation damage, his loss of advertisers, and so on hadn't yet happened, this would still have Twitter now losing 300 million per year opposed to 200 million.  
  
But that's not where we're at.  After the last couple weeks, their future projected revenue is now $2 billion against 6.7 billion in expenses.  Cutting that same workforce still has them at a deficit of $3 billion in the hole for the next year, which goes back to revenue.  They have to get revenue up, and right now they need to do it to the tune of $3 billion from 500 employees, or a ROI of $6 million per employee annually.   To put this into perspective, Google is 1.65 million per employee, Microsoft is 0.56 million per employee, Apple is 2.37 million per employee, and the top company is Netflix at 2.6 million per employee.  Just to help frame how insane $6 million per is, and that's just what he needs to break even.",,ed69d1c63921274388351e921d8c47be569e1e1c0d173ad6,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_iwy92ex,1,1668877366

yzhekc,ix025yo,2022-11-19 18:19:41,"Musk let half the staff go when he took over.  Since then, about half of the employees left have quit.  Do you honestly think that 75% of the employees were not needed and the 25% left are going to be able to deal with any issues that pop up?  Not to mention the people who cut paychecks are among the ones who quit Thursday, so we'll see how many of those 25% are willing to keep working when they aren't getting paid anymore.
Just because it hasn't broken yet doesn't mean it won't and, when it does, there are serious doubts about if the people they have left are going to be able to handle the issues.  It's not a matter of if, but when Twitter is going to crash and how long it will be down.
I used to work in a factory and a new boss came in and told the maintenance guys to stop shutting down one of the chains for maintenance every weekend because it was eating into production time.  They told him that was a bad idea but he didn't listen.  Then, like you, he claimed that everything was OK because for 2 months everything was fine and that proved the weekly maintenance wasn't needed.  But then it broke down and because of no maintenance they had to replace several key components that had failed and  instead of the 16 hours of down time that would have happened over those two months the line was down for a week and they had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on replacement parts.  
My point being that bad choices like what Musk has been making often take a little time before they blow up.

The Roadster was a poor car. The Model S was a lot better but still suffered a lot from being a car from a new car company. Almost the first two years of them all suffered from problems that resulted in every one needing a drivetrain replacement (motor + gearbox + inverter). Some multiple times.
Consumer Reports had an issue with their data source. Their data comes only from their customers. And early customers of Teslas were so in thrall with it that they wouldn't report issues. Musk actively encouraged this with his bunker mentality. ""They are all out to get us, don't help them make us look bad.""
Then CR made a huge, unforgivable, misstep of recommending the Model 3 before it qualified to be recommended. They required car models to prove their reliability for a period of time (2 years I think) before they could be recommended. They had already stretched this idea to say that ""previous similar models"" could be considered, allowing them to recommend Toyotas, Hondas, etc. in the first year or two of release. But there was no such earlier similar model for the Tesla Model 3. They recommended the car before it proved itself anyway and got burned when it turned out to be unreliable.
They said they won't do it again.

yznvlm,ix1ybgr,2022-11-20 02:58:02,"Short answer: the Christians are to blame.
Longer answer: the Christians, aka Jews Lite, have been pretty annoyed with the Jews (Sanhedrim, really) who condemned Jesus and ultimately pressured Pilate to put him to death. Seems stupid to me because no death = no Christianity but fine. So as those Jews became Christians and once skip a few centuries and believe that you're a different religion (as opposed to literally worshipping a Jew as God) then you change how you view Jews.
Considering Jewish home has been conquered many times, they weren't seen as a strong force and when everyone picks on you - and mostly wipes the floor with you - then you're known as a weak tribe and, therefore, easy to scapegoat because what are you going to do other than be conquered and lose your territory once again.
Skip ahead a bit. In Europe, Christians (and Muslims) had usury laws. I.e. you cannot charge people unreasonable interest. Since unreasonable interest is profitable and - depending on credit - it means that economic activity is stifled, it means that a lot of usury laws prohibited Christians and Muslims from lending money to people who couldn't get credit. Jews didn't have this problem so they were able to lend at a high interest. This both increased activity (i.e. made them rich) and made them look greedy because, by definition, the loans were at high interest. However, think of it as payday loans or subprime loans. Due to the significantly higher risk, a significantly higher interest should be charged as a result.
Skip ahead specifically to the 19th century. Jews who were wealthy enough received education and entered various business, legal, banking and other major professions. This means that anytime there's a failure, Jews were blamed instead of individuals who were responsible. Going back to that ""this is a weak old tribe"" plus ""they killed Jesus"", the association is centuries old and continues the scapegoat. As a result of being college educated, they were more likely to belong to the intelligentsia movements which resulted in changing of governments. Changing governments causes major upheaval (and often civil war) and it's not a huge leap to say that clearly Jews instigate overthrow of government and, obviously, to further their greedy banking empires. This is as opposed to the reality where educated people want to change the status quo and rich people tend to continue to stay rich. Nobody is faulting Elon Musk or Bill Gates - non-Jews - from being insanely rich but the second there's a rich Jew then *clearly* they're this rich because they're a Jew.
Skip ahead to end of WWI. Germany lost which seriously destroyed the country and Jews again were blamed for being cowards (even though facts show that a lot more Jews served per capita than non-Jewish Germans) and since the military and politicians were viewed as betraying the population, clearly it was all the Jews who made Germany weak. Again go back to the tribe/Jesus thing. This also means that to Make Germany Great Again, Jews were responsible and their influence must be eliminated. This quickly turned to the entire people being destroyed though there aren't as many discussions about the Slavic race being next.
Skip ahead to just after WWII. Considering the Holocaust was known during the war (and nothing was done), the actual atrocities were finally publicly revealed. Due to various negotiations and changes in ownership of territory going back to WWI, Jews secured their homeland. This once again flared up anti-Jewish tensions with their neighbors trying to destroy them. It didn't work with some serious backing by Western governments. Since then Jews have become more assertive - to put it nicely - where Zionism seems to be a central place in Israel today. It's to the point where being anti-Zionist is somehow anti-Semitic. If someone believes that Israel is being too aggressive against Palestinians when Israel steals Palestinian lands then this is the same thing as Hitler trying to kill all Jews. You can support Jews but you don't have to support Jewish policies and to say that you're required to support everything Israel does or you're anti-Semitic is simply insane and is servile at best. Unfortunately Israel itself (i.e. the government and some Jews) perpetuate this because it's a very easy way to shut down the argument. Most people generally agree that being anti-Semitic is shitty. However this gives those politicians carte blanche to do anything without checks or they call someone anti-Semitic as a result. This creates some backlash where people - including some Jews - are anti-Zionist (which has become rapid expansion of Israeli territory into Palestinian lands) as opposed to maintaining the current state of Israel (not to mention maintaining a secular government rather than a heavily religious one).",,20c464902d271dbd5fece5d62f81580c4eeb135505ae2da7,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ix18mim,1,1668913082

>Analysts say that if Musk has maxed out his borrowing on the 88 million shares (which is highly unlikely) and he has to pledge an additional 60 million shares to fund the Twitter deal, more than 80% of his Tesla fully owned shares would be pledged as collateral.
>That would leave him with about $25 billion in Tesla shares unpledged. If he also has to sell $21 billion of Tesla shares to pay the cash portion of the Twitter deal, as well as the accompanying capital gains taxes, virtually all of his remaining fully owned stock would be pledged.
Also:
>Either way, Musk will be putting a large share of his Tesla wealth at risk, which could make for a bumpy ride ahead for Tesla shareholders.
>Borrowing against shares, Frank said, “exposes shareholders to significant stock price risk due to an executive’s personal financing decisions.”

It is not normal for a someone to slap down an inflated offer to buy out a company while simultaneously locking himself into that price by waiving his right to do any sort of due diligence on the company, then come in as the owner to with no understanding of the inner workings of a company's organizational structure beyond what he could gleam from an org chart,  and no knowledge of its technical infrastructure, and still remove all the organizations that the decision making power was vested in so he could take an axe to the whole org without any institutional guidance.

Facebook wanted to buy TikTok but decided against it when it was deemed a dud on entering the US market; 3ish years later Facebook/Instagram & Google/Youtube are struggling to keep up with it. 
  
As a result, Facebook has been consistently lobbying against its ban by [hiring a GOP strategy firm to lobby against it](https://archive.ph/ERLFo). Zuckerberg says “[Tiktok is a threat to democracy]( 
https://archive.ph/rWDA4)” almost right after an [internal Facebook document leak determined Facebook recognized that it knew their platforms were rapidly losing market share to TikTok](https://archive.ph/wYuvL).  
Because Reddit **at its core is a social platform, just like Facebook**, crossposting is one of the major sources of unique visitors to Reddit *after direct, organic content itself*. 
  
With reports of [advertisers leaving Twitter](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-twitter-list-of-advertisers-leaving-1849751644/), Reddit is in a really opportunistic position to stand out to advertisers looking for a new home to delegate their adspend budget.   
Reddit provides a [one-stop-shop to read success stories](https://www.redditforbusiness.com/success-stories) for ads that many of us have scrolled right past without thinking too much of; more recently, Reddit released a ‘[Meet Your Maker](https://connect.redditinc.com/reddit-presents-meet-your-maker)’ series that focuses on a brand storytelling approach from their prior partnerships.   
  
Reddit has a lot of potential when it comes to working with advertisers. In a study [**90%** of people *who used Reddit for research trust the product information on Reddit more than other sides/apps* and **85%** say *the reviews described by users make them more likely to purchase the product compared to reviews on other sites/apps*](https://www.redditinc.com/assets/case-studies/Research.PathtoPurchase.Reddit.pdf).  
  
  
So, certainly, Twitter is ‘bad place’ now. Reddit remains ‘good place’.   
  
Reddit certainly has [never had any controversies with who owns a stake in the company]((https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18216134/reddit-tencent-investment-deal-memes-amount-winnie-the-pooh-tank-man-china) and how it would impact the user experience.     
  
  
Nor has [Reddit ever refused to give information to a formal investigation](https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Reddit%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf) into how the platform played a role in those “attacks on democracy” Zuckerberg
was so concerned about TikTok being a culprit of.

Given the confusion that surrounds protests and incidents of looting, it can be hard to identify occasions in which deaths are directly linked to involvement in general unrest. A number of deaths identified as linked to protests soon after the events occurred turned out to be unrelated — acts that could callously be called everyday violence.
3) My original comment was mocking Elon Musk How bad his decisions are on banning for his ""free speech"" platform.

1. Trump will _try_ to hold out for some kind of public ego-stroking from Musk. Maybe something about how important Trump is to platform, or how having Trump back will prove that speech is once again free, or whatever.
2. But Trump won't be able to hold out for long and will return whether or not he gets something he can pretend is an expression of fealty. Maybe just 1 or 2 days. Definitely less than a week.
This is just wild, uniformed speculation, but Trump doesn't seem hard to read. A toddler released from what he thinks is an undeserved time out would pout for a moment then give in to the temptation to play. So I think that's what Trump will do too.

You are arguing that the process of becoming a billionaire requires dishonesty. (""Billionaires get their wealth through exploitation. And exploitation is possible only through manipulating data, aka dishonesty."") Therefore, someone that becomes a billionaire _by definition_ would have to be dishonest before they were a billionaire. 
That all said, whatever ... I think I understand your perspective. You're the type that argues that capitalism is inherently evil and exploitative, yes? You're like libertarians that argue that taxation is ""theft."" It's argument by indignation and redefinition, and it always falls apart the moment you learn to apply the principle consistently and without favor _to yourself_. You likely can't see or acknowledge it, but I can all but guarantee you're also ""dishonest"" based on a consistent application of your naive principles here in the same way I can show an libertarian that they're also a ""thief"" by any definition that makes taxation ""theft.""",,77942e3dc59cd1787763eeee6f6ae327be4e540e264979cc,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ix2xysv,1,1668940438

Let me ask you a question, 100% real.
Why are you so absolutely sure he's wrong?
I'm as left as they come, but that doesnt mean I'm blind. The US pretty much shot down basic women's right through the SCOTUS. Trump pretty much told people to assault the government itself. The institutions he believes to be controlled by the left CAN be taken over with enough money (see: Twitter) and yet, even though there hasnt been a ""red wave"" as they anticipated, Republicans only have to course control until next election to have another ""the most contended election ever"" where they might perfectly win by a couple votes or so, to then claim the results were fake whenever it suits them.
Not to mention: fascism is deeply ingrained in ""core american values"". Consider that manifest destiny literally inspired the nazis. Also: things like the Monroe Doctrine or the fact that the US will, in a very bipartisan manner, collaborate with or fund every single dictatorship and theocracy under the sun as long as they allow the american lobbies and corporations take the lion's share of the country.
It's not illogical to believe that fascism is ascending. It is. And democracy is barely escaping by the tips of its fingernails, but democracy has to be lucky all the times while fascism has to be lucky once.
I dont think he relies on the idea of ""there will be more users, more advertisers, more money"", but rather that he knows that if fascism takes over he has to either be part of them or lose everything. 
The left isnt on a good position. Yes, buying Twitter was next tier stupid, but again, he IS Elon Musk, next tier stupid is his trademark.",,f725fd8d9d15ded983c1a8e5c3eab11ddb2d7bc3c84e1695,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ix1wzi2,1,1668949021

That itself paints a decent picture though, doesn't it? 27% of Californians are foreign born, yet 91% of your ex-co-workers are foreign born. Such differences can have perfectly innocent explanations (plain old coincidence with few enough employees or for a cause of some kind), but it's usually a red flag for a business taking advantage of more vulnerable employees. Anything as ""minor"" as low and unfair wages, or abuse, or effectively being held hostage by their employer.

Musk is gutting Twitter for any dissident and malcontents internally under the mask of layoffs and his new “hardcore” ethic. Imagine if you bought a TV station and wanted to make it a competitor to Fox News, you need to get rid of the people who would object and that’s what we’ve witnessed.  As soon as this is all done and dusted, people will forget and continue with their lives…and continue to use Twitter.  
But when we get to election time, Twitter will be primed as the megaphone to control the news cycle once again.  Only this time, there’s no tweet too aggressive or malignant (free speech don’t ya know!).  There won’t be any fact checking and certainly no expectation that promoted content won’t be weaponized for one side.  Those who would question “Twitter is full of bots!” will be met by Musk (aka Tech Trump) saying Twitter has “only the best” bot mitigation and “huge” countermeasures.

z0ywfl,ix8rgcb,2022-11-21 16:53:28,"The one famous Saudi investor is an equity holder, who rolled his shares of old Twitter into Musk's new one - he owns less than 5% of the company.
Along with a handful of other minority shareholders - including Larry Ellison, Binance and [Sequoia Capital](https://archive.ph/QrpeH#selection-4269.0-4271.2) (who also invested in FTX) - he is in the same boat as Musk, and their problem is that they collectively bought Twitter using about $15b of debt, which will cost $1b a year in interest payments. Twitter has made a profit in only 2 years of its history and the total is less than $1b - it was about $200m on one of the two years, I think, can't remember the other.
If Twitter keeps making a loss, and it's a bigger and bigger loss, then these muppets are not going to keep throwing money at it to service the debt and the losses. The Saudi would be responsible for only 5% of the debt, but Ellison has a bit more sense and would be unlikely to do this for long - it's Musk who would have to find most of the billion a year, if Twitter itself can't pay it.
Losses on this scale are not sustainable, and if Twitter can't pay the debt then it's bankrupt - Musk, the Saudi and all the other shareholders are wiped out, and the debt holders basically get whatever Twitter can be sold for (i.e. they'd probably just keep the company as new owners without any debt burden).
People place far too much emphasis on the fact that this one guy is Saudi - he has an investment fund, which may be mostly his own money, but people don't lose money on investments for funsies, not even if they're multibillionaires; he may well be answerable to other investors. Your implication seems to be that this particular Saudi has limitless cash from his oil interests, but that would just be an assumption - you have no idea if he *has* any oil interests; my recollection is that his net worth is less than $10b or $15b, so not enough that he could realistically rescue Twitter on his own.",,cb4f80324e23b19ab417df45af21cc45f09138a8774cc5f7,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ix835x4,1,1669049608

Advertisers attend these events to block purchase huge amounts advertising on Twitter for the entire next year. Thanks to advertiser boycotts Twitter has already lost 20% of next year’s revenue and is currently operating at a loss of $4 million a day.
Musk’s idea of monetizing check marks to try to make back some of that lost revenue blew up in his face thanks to some epic trolling, again brought on by his shitty personality and politics, so he’s not getting any real money there I don’t think.
At a loss of $4 million a day, probably increasing day by day as more of the stink of this causes people to pull advertising, how long can he possibly sustain this for? How long will his ego allow him to keep losing all this money? He can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. There’s no way back for Twitter unless he sells it before it tanks. All the people that quit won’t go back as long as he owns it, and like Trump he won’t have a situation where it looks like he’s done something stupid, so I guess he’s just going to keep doubling down and riding this into the ground until he can find a way to walk away and look like he won.

z0ywfl,ix9di66,2022-11-21 19:19:18,"It really depends what's happening behind the scenes in critical infrastructure departments if we're trying to assess when the service will stop working entirely.
Applications of this size require huge amounts of daily maintenance and upkeep, whether it is installing security patches, fixing critical bugs that pop up, launching mission critical initiatives or simply just responding to routine trouble tickets. It's not like Twitter employees were sitting on their asses doing absolutely nothing all day long. So, all their work needs to be transferred to those who remain. Articles I've read indicated that entire teams responsible for core operating processes have been let go or have quit in protest. Keep in mind that even automated IT processes require manual oversight to ensure they're performed correctly and any errors or issues are resolved.
Other thing to note is that many times when companies downsize, they have an orderly transition plan accounting for critical work. You wind projects down, ensure documentation is in order, shift roles and responsibilities, identify operational risks and come up with contingency plans. With the speed and ferocity of layoffs - as well as confusion regarding Musk's takeover plans and the rapid managerial exodus - I really doubt any of this happened. Institutional knowledge just vanished. Those that remain are in firefighting mode just trying to keep the ship afloat working 2-3 jobs and winging it. They're going to make mistakes and errors. They're going to burn out. They're going to leave.
And you can't count out deliberate internal sabotage, too. When morale is this low after an extremely hostile takeover, those inside Twitter might want to burn it down even more than Musk does. Those that know how to keep a system running also know how to shut it down (and get away with it). 
At some point all we'll have left is a splash screen on Twitter's home page indicating the platform is down for maintenance, otherwise known as ""so much shit is broken in the background and we have no idea how to fix it. Let's see how much time we can buy while we cut features and return with bare minimum operating requirements.""
This could happen in the next hour, next day, or 3-weeks from now. Unless, somehow, Musk is working in the background on an extremely thought-out and well-prepared disaster recovery plan and has the resources in place to execute it - Twitter has disaster recovery plans already, but he's probably fired everyone responsible for executing them, so those plans are garbage at the moment. Based on his impulsiveness and desire to bring in outside Tesla engineers who do not have familiarity with the platform, I really *really* doubt he can pull this off without the help of an established, outside technology partner.

And while midterms are happening (up to and including present-day), he's basically systematically dismantling Twitter.
At the risk of sounding like a crazy conspiracy theorist, I don't think the timing on this stuff is an accident. 
We had an open forum; a world-wide digital town square, with verified identities of important people...and now what? We're all watching it go down in flames?
He's completely ruined the verification system, so reasonable people can't readily trust what we read on Twitter anymore (of course, ""unreasonable people"" (those who don't care about verifying identities, truth, transparency, or fact-checking) are just going to believe who and what they want anyway.)

Yeah, Twitter was borderline essential for coordinating with people, spreading awareness, or even just finding friends and allies for anyone that's a minority.
Trying to do the same on Reddit is cumbersome because everyone is split into walled gardens and if you want to keep up with other people or a community you have to be in their garden ahead of time. Twitter may have encouraged cliques to form and that naturally filtered what you'd see on your feed but at the end of the day, no matter where you were or who you associated with, you were essentially in a public square with every other clique and that made finding out about things important or relevant to you significantly easier and often significantly faster. The best you get with Reddit, if you're not already in the right subreddit, is an r/all post that informs you usually several hours after something has happened.

The moment Musk waived further due diligence (all actually, as he performed none) and made his official $54.20 offer, that $1 billion was off the table.  That offer legally obligated him to purchase at that price if the shareholders approved.

First and foremost, $900,000,000 is plenty of money to start your environmentally conscious motor vehicle companies.
Just ask the founders of Tesla, Martin Eberhard & Marc Tarpenning, neither needed to be billionaires to start that company.
More generally speaking, your mistake is assuming the way things currently work is the only way things could ever work.
We can easily take the money we are siphoning off the top of people worth $900,000,000 and start an ""entrepreneur's fund"" whereby we use those tens of millions of dollars to fund other people's genius ideas instead of only the people who were born rich like Elon Musk or Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos.

Yes and these feats are rewarded to the tune of $900,000,000.

Musk supposedly told Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer that he spoke directly with Putin before [tweeting a peace plan](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ake44z/elon-musk-vladimir-putin-ukraine) that would benefit Russia by keeping Crimea and annexing other areas of Ukraine. 
According to Bremmer, Musk said Putin told him these goals would be accomplished “no matter what,” including a potential nuclear strike if Ukraine invaded Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. 
Bremmer wrote that Musk told him that “everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome.”
Also see [Business Insider article[(https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-blocks-starlink-in-crimea-amid-nuclear-fears-report-2022-10cle]:  ""Elon Musk blocked Ukraine from using Starlink in Crimea over concern that Putin could use nuclear weapons, political analyst says.""

- Devs for iOS app
- Dev for Android app
- Devs for the platform (the backend - database, orchestration, image and video processing, NLP etc.)

- Content moderation platform - the UI they use, the automation and AI NLP...

- Whatever else they are working on (projects that may or may not see light of the day)
- SRE to ensure platform doesnt go down
- Country specific modifications to ensure the platform is legally compliant
- vendor relations for hardware and software
- People who actually take care of the hardware (they own their own datacenter)
- and many more that im missing.

The purchase price is $44 billion, $13 billion of that is financed through debt that was placed on Twitter at an APR of 11.75% (it might be a little higher, it's apparently variable rate, this was the original public filing, but rates changed before the rate activated and similar loans were going for around 15%).  An additional $2? billion is financed by Saudi Arabia, and another $5 billion or so from other outside investors.  The remaining $24 billion, as well as anything his other investors don't pay, is financed by Musk backed by his Tesla shares as collateral.  Also at that 11.75% interest rate.  
  
All of this is used to finance a loan through a bank, which in turn paid for Twitter.  Declaring Twitter bankrupt might wipe out the $13 billion in debt, but significant assets at Twitter would be sold to recoup that.  All of the remaining debt Musk is still on the hook for because he put up Tesla shares as collateral to finance the whole thing.  If any other financing falls through, he still has to pay.  
  
The reason for outside investors is basically to avoid having to sell too much Tesla stock at once since it's not in anyones interest to reduce the value of the collateral.  That said, if he gets into a situation where he has to start quickly liquidating stock, he's on the hook for money, not a specific number of shares, and he would have to do this.

He financed a lawsuit against Gawker in order to put it out of business in revenge. He succeeded. Which leaves one wondering - why was it so imperative to Peter Thiel that no one know he is gay?  This isn’t 1950.            
Thiel  is a rightwinger. Like a lot of Log Cabin Republicans, Thiel doesn’t like “those other gays.” He sees himself as different from the majority of gay people. He’s special.     
Musk is killing Twitter because he can. He doesn’t like when “the left” criticize him. The rightwing adore him because he has money and uses it to subjugate people they don’t like. Musk is performing for the rightwing as they cheer him on.       
They are driven by revenge and by outrage that people who don’t have money or prestige have the nerve to disrespect them. “How dare they? These people don’t have a pot to piss in while I’m rich and powerful. What have these losers ever accomplished? Nothing. I’m going to shut them up and show them what an accomplished, successful person can do to them.”           
This is how despots evolve. They acquire money and power. A percentage of the population admires the rich tough guy who doesn’t give a damn what anyone else thinks. Americans have grown up on tv and movies where cool rich guy says, “Oh yeah? Take THIS.”

- make it so that it's the stockholders who own the company but the employees who get to vote for the board.
- tax billionaires out of existence or cut them down in wealth which would compel the selling of their shares to pay the bill (known reason so it wouldn't tank the price and the company would still exist as it is with a new set of owners, perhaps some previously poor people who were helped by the taxes and can now afford stock). 
- restrict how small a share of the company someone can own while retaining controlling interest. Most guys like Musk own a small portion of the company but have the most power.
- We could also regulate so that CEO compensation is limited as a multiple of lowest paid employees and cannot be tied so strongly to stock price, thereby discouraging the kind of stock pumping lies that Musk engages in.

By better engineers, I don't mean engineers that create new, revolutionary products. I'm talking about the final engineered product. Established manufactures have a century of engineering advances to fall back on and that final result is what I'm referring to. 
And I'm not sure where you can find fault in my opinion on maintenance and parts for established brands. No mechanic on the planet would tell you it's cheaper and easier to fix a Tesla than another car. 
Their footprint and history is exactly why IMO older brands are ahead on this. There are aftermarket versions of basically any part you would ever need as well as a mechanic with experience doing any fix you could imagine for these older brands. Some stuff can even be fixed yourself after watching a youtube video if you're handy. Can't say the same for a Tesla.

He didn't create either of those. He bought Tesla. He bought the technology for Space X. He is not Nikola Tesla. He didn't invent anything. He had a huge amount of money from his generational wealth and selling a company that got dissolved into another company then used that money to invest in two different ventures that just happened to be two extremely important fields right now.

Other companies are focusing on personal space exploration. Musk just hired the people that used to work for NASA that didn't have capitol to do what they were doing. He didn't invent a car. He didn't design anything technically impressive. He is not an engineer. He is some intelligent peoples boss with a ton of money and charisma who says yes or no to things.

Not nearly as fast as my M3LR but stylish, practical, comfortable, I’m just a fan all around. I also love the ioniq5 purely for it’s weird ass interior and display and retro look. They’re the same company and built on the same platform. I was also a fan of the Polestar, but I’d never buy a Chinese car, on principle if anything else. The Tesla is… a minimalist sports car, honestly. Theres nothing fancy about it, it’s not a luxury car, or an innovative design or anything.

The year is 2065. Putin’s commands from his detached brain are dictated actions to his top siloviks via his Elon Musk invented prototype nuerolink sold exclusively to him.
“Open the vats” he commanded near instantaneously into the linked minds of his henchmen. Thousands of vatnik clone super soldiers begin to emerge. These vatnik come out nearly trained from their egg like pods and must simply be directed to the nearest stock of 1853 Crimean War surplus.
“We’re do we go daddy?” 
“We’re you will always go.”
The walls shift and it’s revealed that the pods ring a North Korean made biplane converted with sheetmetal into just kind of a flying barn. Thousands of the VDV vatnik drop, hundreds simply exploding upon impact. Hundreds more immediately extinguishing themselves in friendly fire. At battle’s end, a dozen vatnik remain standing to go fight the actual battle. The Vatnik look around but are unable to cognitively process what they see, as it’s simply fields and fields of clone corpses for as far as the eye could see. The ground veritably melted in human fat around them.
They reach a sign before instantly being mowed down by LMG fire. The sign reads: “Bahkmut.”",,ae7eea3567709a07e92f5e4d3afc10410cccc098bcfe1e8c,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,worldnews,t1_ixlfv9c,1,1669282878

However, despite how I feel about what Musk is doing with Twitter, his views are most likely not that different from any other top CEO of an automotive company. So would buying another brand of vehicle as some sort of protest vote against Elon Musk actually be better?
Tesla has done more than any other company to move the entire automotive industry towards electrification. The rest of the automotive world has been kicking and screaming against any meaningful progress on this front for almost a century. Traditional auto makers and their dealer networks make most of the money from after sales parts and service. This is a major source of income that is lost from electric vehicle sales as electric cars simply have so few wearable parts. Many of the traditional automakers have been involved in falsifying emissions (VW and dieselgate) and actively destroying their electric cars (GM and Ev1 for example). So would buying another brand actually be better in some meaningful way? I doubt it.
Honestly with the amount of time Elon has been out of the Tesla office with his Twitter ambitions, work at SpaceX, Boring Company, Starlink, and Neural Link, and the way he is tanking Tesla stock right now I wouldn't be too surprised if the Tesla board makes a move to replace him if things don't improve. He may be the Tesla CEO, but he wasn't the founder of Tesla and the company can still exist without him.
I am still VERY happy with my Tesla. It is the most American made car based on components and where it is assembled. It is rated as the safest car on the road. Tesla actively employs a lot of veterans. I have driven a lot of exotic vehicles over several decades and my fairly unassuming Tesla family car outperforms them all.

z42je1,ixpp5nc,2022-11-25 09:06:59,"As a satified but always critical Tesla owner (and Musk hater, but that aside) let me get a bit more specific about what you pay for, and how (un)reasonable each feature is:
All Teslas have Standard Connectivity for free. That includes standard navigation, emergency calls, etc. You can upgrade to Premium Connectivity for 10/mo, which enables you to browse the web, stream video and music, have live traffic info, etc. I agree with you that this is entirely reasonable, and the fact that basic nav is free is great. I am happy with my standard connectivity, and have no desire to subscribe.
All Teslas have basic Autopilot (stays in lane on highways, including steering) for free. You can upgrade to Advanced Autopilot, which can change lanes and navigate from on-ramps to off-ramps. Note that any Autopilot only works on highways. The upgrade to Advanced Autopilot is a very big one-time fee. 
Standard Autopilot is occasionally useful. I had the free trial for Advanced, laughed at the ridiculously bad performance, and concluded it is probably worth 100 bucks as a novelty. I’m ok with the fact Tesla charges an extra fee for it, as much as they like, but if you actually buy it you’re stark raving mad.
Full Self Driving is, well, full self driving, and it is a monthly subscription. From what I’ve seen the performance of it is pretty bad. Again, I think the subscription model is entirely reasonable here. You’d just be mad to actually pay for it, because it is a shitty product.
So far, so good. There is exactly one thing about Tesla’s pricing that really pissed me off, though: you had to pay a one-off fee to enable your rear seat heating. THIS sucks, and I’d like to see a ban on this type of crippling of products. I understand that they actually stopped doing this fairly recently. I have still to figure out if I can retroactively get it enabled for free.

1. Musk's ***ownership***, or potential lack-there-of, of SpaceX is irrelevant as far as national security is concerned. As long as you're a US citizen, the US doesn't care who runs their defense companies
2. Under the [Defense Production Act of 1950](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43767/7), The US government has the authority to ""force performance"" of its contracts when it feels that national security concerns justify it. Basically, they can force companies to continue to produce what they've already agreed to produce, or even force companies agree to produce items they have not previously bid on all together. Instead of nationalizing companies for war efforts (which involves *ownership* of a company), the US government just sends government bureaucrats to replace any executives that won't fall in line (which involves *management* of a company).
Look at this way: remember when Musk tried to cancel the Starlink service to Ukraine a couple months back? And then canceled his own cancelation just a couple of days later?

It's the democrats that refuse to hold administrations accountable for the safety of the children, I'm sure not all republicans differ but that doesn't change the fact that the democrats are hyper focused on the guns and not the children committing the acts of violence. 
>You know how to solve gun violence? Reduce the access to and number of guns out there in the world. Enforce laws, make common sense licensing, training and insurance mandatory. It’s not hard - but it does require us stepping beyond the unfounded hypotheticals that stoke fears of government tyranny so that we can deal with the real and immediate crisis of people killing large numbers of innocent people.
This just shows how little you know about gun violence, that vast majority of gun violence is done with illegal weapons and school shootings are a miniscule amount of the issue.
Also, the problem isn't ""gun violence""... it's the fact that the kids have motivation to commit violence... the vast majority of which is illicit and illegal activity using illegal guns, none of which the laws will help (except for something like stop and frisk which stops kids from carrying those guns with them) ... but the school shootings are ceremonial killings/public suicides... which gain in popularity based on the coverage they get which again... the media is 100% responsible for making more popular with how they cover and constantly blame the gun. I mean the vast majority of people dying to guns is black people, more black kids die than all other demographics combined... School shootings is predominately a white crime while drive by shootings are nearly exclusive to black neighborhoods. The vast majority of ""mass shootings"" aren't done with legal weapons and all your solutions won't impact. 
Not only that, but it also shows how ignorant you are to the current availability of weapons in general. We are living through the maker's revolution, technology and manufacturing processes are getting so good that you can buy automated milling equipment relatively cheap and pump out AR15 receivers like their candy or just use a 3d printer and print a gun that have fire at least 9k rounds... well more than anyone needs for a mass shooting. 
> It’s not hard - but it does require us stepping beyond the unfounded hypotheticals that stoke fears of government tyranny so that we can deal with the real and immediate crisis of people killing large numbers of innocent people.
Wrong, it is hard. You think you can just fix the violence by correcting the world and all it does and shift how that violence and depravity manifest in society. You can't just fix people and it's a balance to how much agency we allow for each individual to protect themselves in their own life. The more you try to fix people and force equity, the more of a tyranny is required. 
>Also, as addressed by others, your economic arguments are straight bullshit. Just go have a look at the income and wealth inequality measures over the last 100 years.
I'm not denying wealth inequality, I'm saying it's not a problem as described because even in like pew research's own data on inequality show a growing *upper* middle class out of the lower classes... not only that you're only looking at the absolute value of money when talking about inequality, not standard of living or access to material goods.

Where we see problems in our market, we also see governments putting their thumb on production.
You're complaining about inequality and all I've seen is that's actually been one of strongest assets. It's the differential that creates market opportunities, it just requires people that want to chase after those opportunities... and you know solve the problems society's facing. It's not like Elong Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos... could have stopped once they could afford a few dozen mansions and had their own private jet fleet... no they continue to fund and create more. Thanks to starlink I now have an option out of comcast since they have franchise rights with my town... Greed here isn't even going to have a meaningful impact... they literally don't have any reason to continue working or investing and even if greed is it or they just wanted a commercial option to go to the moon... They had to build it themselves. Either way their gobs of money *do not impact* the cost of chicken and toilet paper for the rest of us. If people just had more money... the prices of goods go up. The reality is the cost of goods are always going to be dependence on the amount of people chasing after them and the percentage of their paycheck they are *willing* to spend on it. Taxing the companies aren't going to magically produce more, supply chains aren't infinitely flexible to meet demand.
We literally start about 10x as many jobs as the next country down and they have about 1 billion more people. What your problem really is about is the challenges that this scale brings... we haven't found solutions for all the pollution it creates and even if we went to fully automated production for all goods, we still wouldn't necessary produce enough for everyone because of the impact on climate/local wildlife. Or local market issues being priced out of areas from that growing upper middle class but because of environmental protection or the not in my back yard mentality keeps preventing other people from coming in and creating more economical housing.

It gives EU governments more power over how platforms moderate content and when tech companies have to take down illegal content. Platforms will need to be transparent about the reasons for content moderation decisions. Affected users will have the right to challenge moderation decisions if their content is removed or access to it is restricted.
If Twitter fails to comply with the DSA's rules, it faces potentially heavy penalties. Regulators could fine Twitter up to six percent of its global turnover or even ban the platform.

If the contracting officer can't provide a valid reason (beyond ""people don't like Musk"") why they rejected a winning, valid offer from SpaceX for a contract; then the government would be looking at court and a contracting officer might be losing their job and their credentials.

It's a check mark.  And people\governement\companies were veried before.  He effectively took it away.  I think there's a previously verified thing but still.... 
I'm sure allowing everyone to purchase the check caused way more  issues for companies than we know and the only reason that some companies may pay the subscription (that gets you nothing but saying it's really me)  is to ensure no one else can pretend to be them. 
It's a pretty manipulative tactic.  But it might work and that's the messed up part.

I.e. Since it would actually be impossible for Twitter to turn enough of a profit (well, especially when it was already running at a loss) to pay off his debts, I'm guessing he's taking the company as soon as possible so he can cash in on selling that sweet Twitter intellectual property. Hopefully that wouldn't involve user data, but who knows really.
This could explain, to some extent, why Musk is so willingly breaking  regulations when it comes to contract terminations, content moderation, etc. Even if countries, or the EU, go after Twitter, all that really does is add to the debt he already can't pay, and further excuse the bankruptcy he's looking for. Most likely, the moment the company gets liquidated, he won't be under criminal or civil prosecution,  as long as he doesn't directly break laws with his troll tweets, so I think in his eyes he has a get out of jail free card and can pretty much do and say anything he'd like. 
I'm guessing a fair amount of prospective buyers would already be ready to snatch that up. Especially if user data was included, governments (esp. authoritarian ones) would be eager to snatch that up. 
It's vile, really. He's willing to not only play and mess up Twitter employees, but he's obviously stoking the fire of right-wing extremism and sectarianist violence.   
I'm guessing he sees all this as a win-win for him. I don't think he believes all the shit he's spouting - he's clearly loving the troll - but I do think he's dropping the crypto of his crypto fascism. I'm guessing he thinks himself above many of his extremist supporters, and is giddy about being able to easily rile them up for his own purposes while at the same time dropping his dog-whistle.

z4q5oi,ixt7ttv,2022-11-26 03:52:40,"Things have happened so fast that I think it's good to take a step back and look at the timeline of events.
1. Twitter originally had no system for verifying accounts. As a result people could easily impersonate public figures and create chaos. 
2. Twitter implements a verification system were public figures can have a blue check next to their name so people know it's really them and not a troll pretending to be them.
3. QAnon level brain rot interprets the blue check as some form of super special status symbol given to the (((elites))) and want it too.
4. Elon Musk, also infected by QAnon brain rot buys Twitter for the memes.
5. He has no idea what Twitter is or how it makes money (to be fair, neither did the previous owners) so he decides to turn the blue check into a $20/month subscription plan.
6. Steven King publicly points out on Twitter that this is a dumb idea and he will leave the platform if it comes to it.
7. Musk immediately bids the price down to $8/month and then makes some statements about how this will make Twitter more democratic. To regular people this statement is confusing but QAnon brainlets are excited to see a public figure be as stupid and clueless as they are.
8. A shit ton of fake troll accounts with the Blue check are made to show Musk what a dumb idea he's triple downed into.
9. Musk announces that parody accounts must identify as parody, thus defeating the purpose of parody and the blue check mark.
10. Parody accounts of Musk labeled parody get taken down because when Musk said comedy is legal now he meant conservative comedy. You know racism.
11. Everyone worries about the fucking nightmare this whole system will create and wonder is Musk is doing election tampering by announcing the switch a week before the US midterm elections.
12. In the meantime Musk creates a new White verification check for actual verified accounts which will be for people who have proved their identity, while insisting the blue check is for the subscription. Which means he's now rendered the blue check and the subscription to have one worthless.
13. Musk announces he will delay the subscription service until after the election to avoid looking like he's meddling in politics but in reality it's because after ten days he's finally realized how idiotic this whole plan is and he needs time to get out without acknowledging he fucked up.
14. Musk ditches the subscription plan entirely, announces a new multi-layered system of verification with different check colors for public figures, people holding government office, and corporations.
15. Twitter has lost 50% of it's ad revenue and the majority of its staff have been layed off or quit.",,43c4050cd7c075aaed41a6086e829ff1e078d883f05fc9e5,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ixt68oz,1,1669434760

Or you don't know what is offered.
> She is locked out of her email, she is locked out of access, she is not considered under employment, not legally, not by her, not by Twitter.
She claims she is being treated as if she were not employed. She says this since she cannot get into the IT systems, attend meetings, etc. This does not mean she is legally not employed.
> She continues to draw a salary because Twitter opted for a 90 day severance payment
That's not what a severance payment means. A severance payment is after you are no longer are drawing a salary.
Read what the musk letter says here:
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/elon-musk-sends-ultimatum-to-twitter-employees-read-the-faqs.html
'2 months of non-working time on payroll (continued compensation and healthbenefits (medical, dental, vision))'
That is not severance, it is employment. Which means your employment doesn't end for 60 days.
It also says:
'In exchange for signing and complying with the terms of a separation agreement,you will receive an additional 1 month of base salary paid as a lump sumfollowing the separation date'
So even if you do not agree with the separation agreement you still get 60 days employment. So even if she badmouths Twitter she still gets 60 days employment.
>  I left my old job a year or so ago, I had 2 months where I still drew a salary because of PTO, but I was not employed.
If you are on PTO, then you are employed. If they pay out your PTO then you are not employed. But that happens immediately, not over 2 months. So if you are held on for 60 days, you are employed, I mean, you *are* drawing a salary, right?
I've been laid off before. Went through that.
> She is GONE.
That is not known at this time. She says she's being treated as if she were gone.
> Irish law states that Twitter would have had to notify the government 30 days BEFORE the ""email survey"".
Not if, as indicated in the text, a no to the survey (or a non-response) means that you will be released in 60 days. As 60 days is more than 30 days warning. Even if you don't agree to the separation agreement you get 60 days that would mean this is in compliance with the required 30 days warning before termination of employment.
> By not answering yes she ""agreed"" to take 90 day severance. Which in itself is not gonna fly well.
We're going to see exactly what that meant. The article says severance, you say severance, but what you link it is not what you say severance is. It is what I described. A payout after/as your employment ends. It is the 30 days in the text at the link above, not the 60 days.
If she really is not employed now then it would seem obvious Twitter violated Irish law. If the ""severance"" mention in the article is a misstatement and instead she is employed for 60 days, but told not to come into work, then likely the law is not violated.
We will have to find out.",,f30bdcc50b918200352c3935bc6ee62b4cc92596ceab30e2,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ixtb3dk,1,1669438148

z4q5oi,ixthzgk,2022-11-26 05:36:15,"Well that isn't wrong but mDAU is a really complicated metric that Twitter uses.  The m obviously stands for ""monetizable"".  Not that they are ensured to make money, only that their stands a potential.  So an increase of mDAU doesn't mean profit, it just means there are more eyeballs.
But that's also another question to be asked.  How many of those eyeballs are real ones?  And that's literally the very thing Musk originally questioned Twitter about their original mDAU before he bought the thing.  So an increase could also mean that bot detection might be failing or is no longer turned on.
But the reality is, mDAU is just a complicated and difficult to unpack metric because Twitter has always made it defined to be complex and difficult to defined.  So I wouldn't be breaking out the bubbly and popping the cork just yet.  But also, I would caution people who are trying to predict Twitter's demise.
Twitter has a lot of inertia and even if Musk fucks it up for several years in a row, it's going to take a lot for it to eventually fail.  The real concern for Musk at this moment is to start generating a steady stream of revenue.  Profit can come later, but right now, Musk needs to stabilize the revenue he is receiving.  And in all fairness, every major company shakeup has a period of instability and Twitter is clearly no different.
$44B is a lot of money and Musk really needs to ensure that revenue starts getting way more stable a lot faster than most major shakeups.  It's just a massive amount of being over leveraged he's in.  Perhaps he'll do it, maybe he won't.  But honestly, I don't know why people just keep refusing to take the ""wait and see"" approach to it?
I know where I stand, I don't really like Twitter, haven't since 2013.  And really I don't like Reddit either except for r/HuskyTantrums, r/lotrmemes, and a few other subreddits, but gosh I really dislike the ""hot take expo"" that Twitter has become and Musk really embodies that mantra.  So that really pushes me further from wanting to really use it.  But Twitter is Musk's ship.  He wants to steer it in the direction he's going, it's his baby to steer as he sees fit for all I care.

Companies are not democratic institutions, they have totalitarian organizational structures, meaning that there is a boss at the top and has full authority. Twitter used that power to mute the US president, but in the end it backfired, as we can witness now. From that moment on Twitter became a political party, if you want admit it or not. And if Elon Musk wouldn't have come along to buy it, someone else would, that's how the market works. Twitter would have been better off if it would have involved a legal institution regarding the blocking of the US president's account, but they did it all on their own policy, because they knew that the democratic legitimated laws wouldn't suffice.

Musk is doing exactly what a whole lot of people predicted he'd be doing. Not on purpose, but because he doesn't know any better. He didn't make the offer for Twitter because he thought he could make more money with it. That was never part of what he talked about. He bought Twitter because he thought of himself as an activist, and wanted to change Twitter based on ideological priorities, not financial ones. 
It took him a month to figure out that ideology doesn't pay the bills and he was way overpaying, and that the resulting financial reality was horrible. So he tried to get out of it. But of course he couldn't. 
So, not having any clear *practical* goals for how to run the company and improve financials, he decided that focusing on his ideological goals was the way to go. Which, of course, his ideological goals were detrimental to the financial goals, but he was too wrapped up in his ideology to accept that. 
That covers the policy changes, what about the layoffs and resignations? Understand that Musk has never executed a takeover at this scale before. He's used to taking over companies when they're tiny. The closest thing in his history is when x.com merged with confinity, and that was much smaller, and a merger rather than a takeover, and while he took the CEO job for a bit, he was pushed out because he wasn't good at it. 
He literally doesn't know how to do this type of takeover, and he's not delegating to people who do know. So instead of evaluating each position against the mid and long term goals (that don't exist) getting rid of the ones that don't directly contribute, he's just slashed headcount across the board - then started throwing out possible goals, and learning that he needs some of the people he fired to meet them. Whoops. 
The rest, the whole ""fire half the staff then tell everyone left they'll be expected to work 80 hours a week"" ""hardcore"" bullshit, that's the way Musk has *always* led. He hires young talent that is caught in his cult of personality, burns their candle at both ends, then replaces them when they leave. And it works because there's a huge line of people just waiting to work for Musk. But those mostly weren't the people already working at Twitter, so they took the severance. 
It's all very easy to understand when you realize the very first piece that most corporate takeovers need was missing - a plan for how to make more money.",,ee4ae0d868345afa93a9924bdc95a73abf481bbe78e757c2,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ixsy1cc,1,1669466462

z4q5oi,ixw6yo0,2022-11-26 21:19:26,"This post was about people criticising what Musk did at twitter and I addressed the point that Twitter is still there, functioning and has had an large increase in usage. This sounds very much in contrast to what people are saying. 
Yet all these people are not checking in with reality. It’s like standing outside a building and saying that the buildings half burnt down, yet it is still standing with no signs of fire. At what stage do you assess reality and look at the building and question if it is burnt down. This same response to what the media is saying is why Trump got into power. 
In response to your “off comment” and your vilification of my character, here are some comments
I have done over 4000 hours of research on a topic, when i see things with contrasting information i reply about it.
Many posts made by people are biased based on what’s they have read, which in many cases are articles that are plainly untrue or articles the cite unnamed sources where quite a few are then proven false over a period of time.
My analysis of Musk is of someone that has many flaws,  is asked publicly about issues he only knows a little about, to which he always tries to answer, which leads to criticism, which he corrects. 
He is a technical smart person who is driven by ultimate goals which are in many cases goals that are socially correct, but taken from a level which many don’t understand. It’s like gates being presented with someone in a wheel chair asking for help, vs large scale disease, gates doesn’t help the person in a wheel chair, but rather takes the numbers approach which is to attack problems in a way which saves the largest percentage of people. (People also complain about this)
By being driven by this goal he sets unrealistic or optimistic time frames, which can be seen as a good or bad thing. It can be seen as good as if he didn’t spacex and tesla would never have succeeded. These ultimate goals lead to criticism of work ethics as he required all staff to put in long hours and achieve the outcome. He typically would rather have one person work hard and extra hours than three people doing the same job as inter-job communication drives lower efficiency.
This issue with workers rights leads people to complain about him, with people discussing unions even when the telsa employees receive higher pays that other auto companies. Due to his attitude to this and when you have the community bring up issues, it tends to force Musk to alter his plan and prove them wrong or double down . A perfect example is mega casting which address the tolerance stacks when combining multiple small pieces together, this meant that the build quality of the car is now 2-3 orders of magnitude better
In this circumstance (labour)it has lead him full circular to more automation and leverage of existing technologies into a product that seems impossible, being a humaniod robot. You will be able to judge the outcome of this over the next 3-4 years, but it is likely that it will half the number of production staff required at his factories. Musks understanding of these engineering tasks can be seen all over this project, from the range of motion to the simplification of each finger to the same mechanism.
He has many human flaws and I could write a thesis just on how power has led to some of his decisions being corrupt, or how he called a guy a pedophile in a direct response to an attack on Musks character. 
But if you don’t look at the bigger percentage, you can be sacrificing good for bad. 
What benefit do you bring society but attacking me and my Understanding or attacking Musk. Do you attack this stance because you are a bully? Or is their a reason you would be here attacking what he is trying to do vs attacking or standing up for the people of Ukraine or North Korea. 
Is there a real social cause of your action, maybe we can argue the pros and cons of that? We (or at least you should) know that life is full of compromises. 
Tell me, You attack musk because……. and that helps the world because…… to the detriment of ……",,ea8559695868a35b3203ddd3fcc36f96b52dbdcd8860cc4c,aadb59c4da75af6c9fb8d5cb4c310ce59888aab7f96ffc15,,,,,,news,t1_ixvg15g,1,1669497566

Yes, there was. Massive issues actually. Verified accounts were getting sold at insane volumes - And a majority of them were hacked. Sure, you were not able to change the handle, but you could change your name, profile picture, and everything like that, and then just let your bot go on rampage.

I’m also saying that ethics are not exchanged. Your ethics are individual to you. If you behave in a way where your ethics depend on how you’re treated then we’re not discussing ethics. That’s just tit for tat. Someone who is ethical lives and behaves within the lane they believe in or adhere to professionally, regardless of how they’re treated.
